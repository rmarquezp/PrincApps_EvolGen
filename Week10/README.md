Evaluating Discrete Population Structure
=============================

Population structure is a universal feature of biological systems, and studying it can provide valuable informationon a variety of their features, ranging from their biogeographic history to their ecological dynamics. Today we will explore population history between populations of <i> Heliconius hermathena</i>, a rare, sparsely distributed butterfly species from the Brazilian Amazon.
