Evaluating Discrete Population Structure
=============================

Population structure is a universal feature of biological systems, and studying it can provide valuable informationon a variety of their features, ranging from their biogeographic history to their ecological dynamics. Today we will explore population history between populations of <i> Heliconius hermathena</i>, a rare, sparsely distributed butterfly species from the Brazilian Amazon, using data generated by [Massardo et al. (2020)](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-020-00797-1).

There are multiple subspecies of <i>H. hermathena</i> most of which have quite restricted and fragmented ranges in compariosn to other species of <i>Heliconius</i>. We will focus on <i>H. h. sabinae</i> and <i>H. h. sheppardi</i>, which inhabit the Northwestern Amazon and Japurá/Caquetá river basins (red, yellow, and purple dots in the map above). The data for today have already been downloaded, quality-trimmed, and mapped to the reference genome for <i>Heliconius melpomene</i> using the code from [Week 2](../Week2). In today's practical we will explore the extent of population structure between sampled localities, and define a set of populations that meet the assumptions of discrete population structure models.
