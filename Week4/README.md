Estimating Site Frequency Spectra
===================================

As we discussed in lecture, the site frequency spectrum (SFS; also known as allele frequency spectrum) is a widely-used and very informative statistic to summarize genetic variation within a population. Today's practical will deal with estimating the SFS using different approaches, and using it to calculate other summary statistics, namely the various estimators of $\theta$ that we have used in the past.
