Handling Illumina data on the Greatlakes HPC Cluster
====================================================

This week we will begin working with data. As we discussed in lecture, one of the most comonly used genotyping strategies in current population genetic studies consists on using the Illumina technology to sequence short fragments of DNA, which we will call <b>reads</b>. These short reads are them aligned against a previously generated reference genome, which allows us to 1. find their location in the genome, and 2. obtain genotypic information for our individual(s) of interest. 
<br>In this practical we will learn how to:<br>
*Download data from the NCBI's Short Read Archive, a public repository of sequence data (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra).
