Demographic Inference using Coalescence
==========

The evolutionary history of a lineage is often marked by changes in population size. Therefore, estimating historical demographic changes can be a highly informative approach for evolutionary biologists. Coalescent theory provides a powerful framework for this, since the rate of coalescence depends on the (effective) population size. Today we will be impleenting two approaches for demographic inference under the coalescent model: The "skyline" plot and demographic parameter estimation from the site frequency spectrum (SFS). For today's lab you will some software installed: <a href="https://www.beast2.org/" >BEAST2</a>, a very powerful suite of programs for the inference and analysis of evolutionary trees, <a href="https://github.com/beast-dev/tracer/releases/tag/v1.7.2" >Tracer</a>, used to visualize the results of Bayesian MCMC analysis, and <a href="http://cmpg.unibe.ch/software/fastsimcoal27/">fastsimcoal2<a/>. If you haven't please install the first two (locally) on
